# My portfolio
[https://marcodifrancesco.com](https://marcodifrancesco.com)

The portfolio is constantly (hopefully) updated with all the projects I've made in the last years.

## Install

**Ruby version: 3.2**

```bash
# 'sudo' only used for Bump ubuntu because I don't want to fix all the caching related permission problems
sudo bundle install
```

## Execute

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --host 0.0.0.0
```

Note: `host` is set to access it through the network with local IP
