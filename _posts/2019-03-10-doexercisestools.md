## What's this?

This program is made to plot data of all the students that are attending Probability and Statistics class using [doexercises platform](http://datascience.maths.unitn.it/doexercises/).

With this programs you are able to:

- [Brute force ID numbers](https://github.com/MarcoDiFrancesco/DoexercisesTools/blob/master/bruteForceMatricola.py) (matricole) of students
- [Download marks](https://github.com/MarcoDiFrancesco/DoexercisesTools/blob/master/getMarks.py) of the students you have the ID number, and put them in a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)
- [Request token](https://github.com/MarcoDiFrancesco/DoexercisesTools/blob/master/requestToken.py) continuously (useful for the 1st May exercise)

## Plot example

[Spreadsheet of 2019 marks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDTFy_oSF6smH6gWwwt4T3QZtLoTRGazkQRKLxoxvhQ/pubhtml)  
_The students ID are not publicly available in the spreadsheet_

## Requirements

Python.

Gspread (Google Spreadsheets) libraries:

```Bash
pip install gspread
```

Selenium libraries installed

```Bash
pip install -U selenium
```

Oauth2client

```Bash
pip install oauth2client
```

Selenium driver to make it working with Chrome, old version of the drivers is already present in the repository: [Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

## How to use it

The script [Download marks](/getMarks.py) needs:

- A [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets), once done copy the link key into the programs you want to use in the section  
  `sheet = gc.open_by_key()`  
  e.g. with the link

```Bash
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDTFy_oSF6smH6gWwwt4T3QZtLoTRGazkQRKLxoxvhQ
```

write the last part of the link

```Python
sheet = gc.open_by_key('1xDTFy_oSF6smH6gWwwt4T3QZtLoTRGazkQRKLxoxvhQ')
```

- Drive API on [Cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) to connect it with Spreadsheet, ([tutorial](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python)), once downloaded the Spreadsheets API in JSON format, rename the file to `credentials.json` and put it the project folder

The output should look like:

<!-- cmd output downlaod marks -->
