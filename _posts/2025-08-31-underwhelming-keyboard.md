Following the previous post 8 days ago: [2025-08-23-new-beautiful-keyboard](/2025-08-23-new-beautiful-keyboard)

Tried out LoFree Flow for 3 days now and from the first moment I received it I was underwhelmed. My priorities have definitely changed:

- **Sound**: it seriously sounds super wood-chopping-like in Stardew Valley. The switches are too silent, Tatiana even said it’s more silent than the office keyboard. I figured out I have a soft touch and can handle switches that can make more noise. The Nuphy Air v3 seems to be louder and a better choice.
- ~~Blueooth 2-5 sec sleep recovery time:~~ Bullshit, the LoFree flow reconnects immediately. I don’t even have the time to click one key that it has already reconnected.
- **Programmable**: Huge issue with LoFree Flow at the office is that I need to have the “Meta + hjkl” keys for the arrows. Moving right hand to the arrows in the office keyboard was intuitive since there was a gap between the main part of the keyboard (the rectangle from Ctrl to Del), and the four arrow keys. On the other hand with the contiguous keys in the 75% keyboard smash together the arrow keys with the ctrl and shift keys and make it much more difficult to have the muscle memory to click them.
- **Black vs white**: the first keyboard was black I had with RGB backlights you can’t really see the backlighting easily, I’d rather try out the new white + shine through keycaps. Plus, I started this whole rabbit whole from “I want a beautiful white keyboard” and I should stick to it, not defaulting back to black as always.
- **Shine through keycaps**: they are a must. Seriosly, today they are a must. Yesterday I didn’t care about them but today I can’t live without them. This morning (it’s 8:35, shit it’s early) I fell in love after seeing that the LoFree Flow v2 in white with white backlights, and shit if it looks good. Since today is the last day I give myself to buy the keyboard I will just take them. Fuck it, I got money, I need to spend them too.

Conclusions:

- I bought from the official website the Nuphy Air75 v3 with the white shine through keycaps (which yesterday were not available, it was destiny). I hope I don’t regret it since I spent 175$ after discount on it. Shit if it’s a lot of money.
- Only thing I’m afraid is that, like the LoFree Flow, it will be underwhelming when I’ll receive it. In the picture and youtube videos it looks so damn good, then you receive it and looks like an average keyboard with a metal frame. Let’s hope I won’t have that feeling.
