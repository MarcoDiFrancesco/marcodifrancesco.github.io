In Aug 2025, after 4 months in Corner I have a sudden will to have a beautiful keyboard in the office. I want it so that if someone approaches me they say: “wow, that’s really a beautiful keyboard”.

**Requirements**:

- Beautiful.
- Low profile
- Silent: e.g. linear switches
- 75%, 84 keys
- Color: fully white (if possible)
- Price: max 150 euros
- 2.4 Ghz usb dongle to avoid 2-5 sec sleep recovery time (mentioned below)

**Options by company**:

- **Lofree**: most well known brand in youtube, they make by far the most beautiful keyboards
    - Flow: most beautiful of them all: alluminium, beautiful edges, but unadvised to buy really an older model given the market is improving very quickly for low-profile keyboards.

    - ~~Flow v2~~: horrible 2cm right edge, was better the v1 design. Relased in kickstarter in Aug 2025, and despite being super new, the right edge has everyone asking “why, just, why?!”

    - Flow lite: plastic which makes it 10% lighter, 20 euros cheaper, released in Sep 2024. Plastic makes it much less beatiful, for 20 euros less I don’t feel poor enough to buy it.

- **Nuphy**: the most recognized brand with Lofree.
    - Air75 v3: loved among the reddit community which hates Lofree for lack of transparency (whatever it means). But seriously, I don’t need to handle to zoom on the top right of the keyboard.

- **Keykron**: company seen as competition for the first two, at half of the price. Around $80 instead of the range $120-$160.
    - K3: similar to what Bozzo had in FBK and looking much less like “professionally mac-looking beautiful white” and much more “I’m a computer scientist that types in the 10 keys method”.

**Lofree Flow overview:**

- Switches overview:
    - Flow (white version): Ghost linear switches
    - Flow lite (every color version): Specter switches, very similar to the Ghost switches
    - Purchase separately: Hades switches, much more silent than the Specter/Ghost, compatible both with Flow and Flow lite.
- If Ghost Linear Switches switches are too loud in the office I can buy for 60-70 euros the Hades switches. I highly doubt the noise is a problem given the noise Gabriele makes when typing and during the calls, and people from the other team scream a lot without anyone even complaining. But still good to have a silent keyboards for future offices.
- Bluetooth reconnection issue: after 10 minutes of inactivity the keyboard enters sleep mode and reconnection takes 2-5 seconds (some users say 1s, some 8s). This could be fixed by the 2.4 Ghz dongle which the Flow lacks, and only solution is to use the cabled connection at all time. Pro is that when it’s reconnecting the keys are remembered.
    - Bluetooth mode my perspective: the keys are remembered when it’s reconnecting. For example, if it goes to sleep after I loked the screen, I’ll be typing the password in ~3 seconds, by the time I hit enter the keyboard has waken up and in than instance it’s definetly usable.
    - Cabled mode my perspective: even if it looks less shiny, keeping the cable plugged at all time may seem a reasonable tradeoff for its beauty. If I’m changing desk I’m anyway not taking the keyboard with me and that wouldn’t be an issue.

**Conclusions**:

- Lofree Flow is a no brainer after I found it for 144 euros on amazon fr that ships in Switzerland. Even considering the bluetooth connection issues, the first-sight love is still standing strong. Every partner has it’s flaws.
